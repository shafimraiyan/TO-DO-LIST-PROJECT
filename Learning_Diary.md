LEARNING DIARY, FRONT-END MODULE

Date : 08.09.2024
Activity: Set up Git and GitHub repository
Learning outcome: Today, I learned how to initialize a Git repository and commit changes
for version control. I know how to push a local repository to GitHub using SSH
authentication. The steps involved setting up SSH keys for secure access to GitHub. This
activity helped me understand the importance of version control in software development
and how GitHub can be used as a collaborative tool for sharing code.

Activity: Set up VS Code development environment
Learning outcome: I installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and set up my development
environment by adding essential extensions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also
configured the live server extension, which allows me to see changes in real time as I code.
This significantly boosted my productivity, and I learned how a well configured code
editor can simplify the development process.

Activity: Created the basic structure of the To-Do List application
Learning Outcome: I have built the skeleton of my To-Do List app using HTML and CSS.
This involved creating a form to input tasks and setting up a list container to display them.
I learned how to structure the UI using semantic HTML and improved my understanding
of how CSS is used for layout and styling. I also practiced using Flexbox for layout
adjustments.

Date: 23.09.2024
Activity: Added JavaScript functionality to the To-Do List application
Learning Outcome: Today, I implemented the core functionality of the To-Do List app
using JavaScript. I learned how to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete by
manipulating the DOM. This was a hands-on way to understand how JavaScript can bring
interactivity to a static web page. I also implemented event listeners to trigger functions
when the user interacts with the form and buttons.Date: 24.09.2024
Activity: Integrated LocalStorage for task persistence
Learning outcome: I added LocalStorage to my To-Do List app, allowing tasks to be saved
and loaded even after the browser is refreshed. This was my first experience working with
LocalStorage, and I learned how to store, retrieve, and delete items in the browserâ€™s
storage. Understanding how to implement persistence in a client-side application was a
valuable lesson.

Date: 25.09.2024
Activity: Styled the application using CSS for responsive design
Learning outcome: I focused on improving the design of the To-Do List app by adding
custom styles. Using CSS Flexbox and Grid, I created a responsive design that adapts to
different screen sizes. I also experimented with color schemes, fonts, and hover effects to
enhance the user experience. This activity deepened my knowledge of CSS layout
techniques and responsive web design principles.

Date: 29.09.2024
Activity: Deployed the project using GitHub Pages
Learning Outcome: I deployed my To-Do List app using GitHub Pages, making the project
publicly accessible. This was my first time deploying a project, and I learned how GitHub
Pages can be used to host static websites. The deployment process taught me the
importance of keeping a clean and organized repository, especially when working with
remote branches and tracking changes. Seeing the project live gave me a sense of
accomplishment and an understanding of the full development cycle.

Date: 01.10.2024
Activity: Created a README file for the project
Learning Outcome: I wrote a detailed README file for this user friendly project outlining
the features, setup instructions and usage information. It was important to reinforce a clear
documentation as in making my project accessible to others. It helped me to reflect on
what I had accomplished.

Reflection
This project has been an invaluable learning expeirnce in front-end development. I have
gained on hand experince in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learned how to integrate
client-side storage using LocalStorage. Setting up a Git repository and deploying the
project to GitHub Pages taught me the full cycle of development from coding to
deployment. Additionally, documenting the project through the README file helped me
improve my communication skills and reinforced the importance of sharing code with
proper explanations. Overall, this module has prepared me to handle front-end projects
more confidently and effectively.
