# To-Do List Project




## Overview

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's LocalStorage, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.


## Features:

- Add new tasks: Users can input tasks, which are displayed as a list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Clicking on a task strikes it out, indicating completion.
- Remove tasks: Each task has a delete button (x) that removes the task from the list.
- Persistent storage: The app uses LocalStorage to save tasks, so they remain even after the page is reloaded.
