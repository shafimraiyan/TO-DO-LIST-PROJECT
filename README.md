# To-Do List Project




## Overview

This project is a responsive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, completing, and deleting items, with data saved in the browser's LocalStorage for persistence. The app also features a navigation bar for better layout and ease of access.

## Features:

- Add new tasks: Users can input tasks, which are displayed as a list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Clicking on a task strikes it out, indicating completion.
- Remove tasks: Each task has a delete button (x) that removes the task from the list.
- Persistent storage: The app uses LocalStorage to save tasks, so they remain even after the page is reloaded.
- Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, utilizing Flexbox and CSS Grid to adapt to various screen sizes.
