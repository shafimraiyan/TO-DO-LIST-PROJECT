Project Overview
This is a To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:

Add tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks
Persist data using LocalStorage, so tasks remain saved even after the browser is refreshed.
The goal of this project is to create a simple yet functional front-end app while reinforcing key front-end development concepts like DOM manipulation, LocalStorage, and responsive design.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can input a task and add it to the list.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Clicking on a task marks it as completed by striking through the text.
Delete Tasks: Each task has a delete button (x) that removes it from the list.
Task Persistence: LocalStorage is used to save the task list, ensuring that tasks persist even when the page is refreshed.
Responsive Design: The app is mobile-friendly and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
